      <p>Dr. Jacob Wheeler Bird (1885-1959) is remembered as one of the founders of Cambridge Hospital in Olney, Maryland,
        and is said to have delivered 4000 babies during his career. Dr. Bird was born in Anne Arundel County and
        graduated from the University of Maryland Medical School. Dr. Bird arrived in Sandy Spring, Maryland in the 1910's
        with the dream of beginning his medical practice. He rented Wrenwood, a private home, which became his first
        hospital. In 1918, the original hospital had 28 beds. He and his second wife, Jean Skinner Bird were killed in an
        automobile crash in or near Huntsville, Alabama.</p>

      <p>Massive Pulmonary Embolism :<br>
        55-year-old female with past medical history of AIDS, dilated cardiomyopathy and prior deep venous thrombosis was
        found to be hypotensive and in respiratory distress.<br>
        She was brought to the emergency department, where vital signs were notable for temperature of 100.9ºF,
        HR=142/min, BP=90/60 mmHg after intravenous fluids, with oxygen saturation of 99% while breathing 100% oxygen via
        non-rebreather mask. Computed tomography of the chest with pulmonary angiogram protocol (Figure 1) revealed large,
        thrombi in the right main and left main pulmonary arteries with incomplete occlusion, in addition to multiple
        segmental thrombi in right upper, middle and lower lobes. Anticoagulation was initiated and the patient was
        transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.<br>
        Norepinephrine was discontinued by ICU day 6 and the patient’s oxygenation slowly improved, and mechanical
        ventilation was successfully discontinued on ICU day 8. Renal function improved without need for dialysis. The
        patient recovered to her baseline status and was discharged on hospital day 39.
